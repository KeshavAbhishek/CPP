Write one line for each kewords used in C++ language written below:

asm - Used to insert assembly language code into C++ programs.
auto - Used to automatically deduce the data type of a variable during declaration.
bool - Represents boolean values, either true or false.
break - Used to exit from a loop or switch statement.
case - Used in switch statements to define individual cases.
catch - Used to catch and handle exceptions in exception handling.
char - Represents single characters or small integer values.
class - Used to define a user-defined data type along with its properties and methods.
const - Specifies that a variable's value cannot be modified after initialization.
const_cast - Used for type-casting away the const-ness of a variable.
continue - Used to skip the rest of the loop iteration and start the next iteration.
default - Defines the default case in a switch statement.
delete - Used to free dynamically allocated memory.
do - Used to create a do-while loop.
double - Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
dynamic_cast - Used for safe casting of polymorphic types.
else - Used to define the alternative branch in an if statement.
enum - Used to define an enumeration, a user-defined type consisting of named integer constants.
explicit - Specifies that a constructor should not be implicitly used for type conversions.
export - Not used in modern C++. Historically used for specifying exported templates.
extern - Declares a variable or function that is defined in another translation unit.
false - Represents the boolean value "false".
float - Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
for - Used to create a loop that repeats a specified number of times.
friend - Grants a function or class access to private members of another class.
goto - Used to transfer control to a labeled statement.
if - Used for conditional execution of code.
inline - Suggests the compiler to inline a function for optimization.
int - Represents integer values.
long - Represents long integer values.
mutable - Specifies that a member variable can be modified even in a const member function.
namespace - Defines a scope to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.
new - Allocates memory for a new object or array.
operator - Used to define custom operators for user-defined types.
private - Specifies that class members are only accessible within the class.
protected - Specifies that class members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
public - Specifies that class members are accessible from any code.
register - Suggests that a variable be stored in a processor register for faster access.
reinterpret_cast - Used for low-level type casting with no specific type checking.
return - Used to exit a function and return a value to the caller.
short - Represents short integer values.
signed - Specifies signed integer types.
sizeof - Returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or object.
static - Specifies that a variable or function is shared among all instances of a class.
static_cast - Used for type casting between compatible types.
struct - Defines a user-defined data type, similar to a class but with default public access.
switch - Used for multi-way decision-making based on the value of an expression.
template - Used to define generic functions or classes.
this - Refers to the current instance of a class.
throw - Used to raise an exception in exception handling.
true - Represents the boolean value "true".
try - Used to start a block of code where exceptions are handled.
typedef - Used to create an alias for a data type.
typeid - Returns information about the type of an expression.
typename - Specifies that a dependent name in a template is a type.
union - Defines a user-defined data type that can hold members of different types but only one at
a time.
unsigned - Specifies unsigned integer types.
using - Introduces a namespace or a specific member from a namespace.
virtual - Declares a member function to be polymorphic, allowing dynamic binding.
void - Represents the absence of a type or the return type of a function that does not return a
value.
volatile - Specifies that a variable can be modified by external influences.
wchar_t - Represents wide characters used in Unicode strings.
while - Used to create a loop that continues as long as a specified condition is true.
